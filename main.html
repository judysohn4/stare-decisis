    <strong> <div style = "font-size: 20px;">BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY</div></strong>
<br>

Following my first piece on the LGBTQ+ community as well as my follow-up podcast on queer suspectives, this article focuses on BOSTOCK v. CLAYTON COUNTY.

BOSTOCK v. CLAYTON COUNTY took place in 2019 when, in several cases, an employer allegedly fired a long-time employee simply because they were homosexual or transgender. 

The basis for the cases was Title VII, which was established in 1964. Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. The key to this landmark in the LGBTQ+ community is the basis for Title VII liability. 

The employers stated that, under the dictionary definition around 1964, ‚Äúsex‚Äù referred to ‚Äústatus as either male or female [as] determined by reproductive biology.‚Äù Regardless of the time period, the employees argued that the term had a broader scope beyond just anatomy and encompassed gender identity and sexual orientation. 

Another essential part of the argument was that VII protected individuals against discrimination, not groups, which is important to recognize because the employees were fired, at least partially, because of their sex ‚Äî even though men and women are equal under LGBTQ discrimination. 

On the other hand, right leaning justices, Justice Alito and Justice Thomas, claimed that one must consider the social context in order to apply the enactment, meaning that the 1964 usage of the word ‚Äúsex‚Äù would not have included LGBTQ workers as sexual orienation was a under-explored topic back then. 

Actually, however, Justice Gorsuch ‚Äî who had the majority opinion ‚Äî also applied a textualist reading of Title VII. 

‚ÄúJudges are not free to overlook plain statutory commands on the strength of nothing more than suppositions about intentions or guesswork about expectations,‚Äù Gorsuch said. 

Therefore, on June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court held that every state in the country is protected under federal law against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in a job or from an employer that has at least 15 employees.
