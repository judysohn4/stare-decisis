                <p style = "text-align: right;">  Hi! My name is Jaimie, and I am a junior at Sunny Hills High School. I am currently the managing editor and was a copy editor for The Accolade, my high school's online publication and print newspaper. I first dipped my foot into journalism through the Journalism 1 class my freshman year, which ended up being life changing for me. Under the wing of inspiring upperclassmen editors and adviser, I have been able to foster my journalistic and writing skills. Whether it's writing a story, recording a podcast or designing layouts, I'm always appreciating how journalism has allowed me to explore the topics I am passionate about and, more importantly, spread awareness on those issues. Enjoy! </p>

                <p> Hi, my name is Judy Sohn, a current junior at Leland High School, and I am the web developer of Stare Decisis. Although I am not the best writer, I enjoy building a platform where journalism works of my peers can be showcased. I like to code and make projects ranging from mobile apps to online websites like this one, and aim to spread awareness about issues important to me as well as display my personal interests through these projects. </p>

                <p style = "text-align:right;">Hi! I’m Suvia and I am a current junior at Leland High School in San Jose, California. I have been part of Leland’s journalism team for our newspaper, The Charger Account, for the last two years. I currently serve as the Opinions Page Editor of our paper. Doing journalism has given me the opportunity to write and create publications on issues that are important to me— every step of the journalistic process, from coming up with relevant story ideas to putting together my page, is exciting. Spreading awareness on relevant issues in our communities is extremely important and I am grateful to serve on State Decisis’ team.

                <p> Hello! I'm Inseo, a junior at Leland High School. I love to draw digitally and incorporate stories into my art, so I was very excited to join this project. At school, I am part of the student newspaper called the Charger Account. As a page editor and artist, I collaborate with my peers to present current events to the community. Some topics that interest me in particular are pop culture, the environment, and entertainment.
