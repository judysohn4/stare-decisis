                ~a collection of unknown to now known legal terms~ 
                <br><br>

                <strong>Stare Decisis </strong>: the legal principle of determining points in litigation according to precedent <br><br>
                
                Held: decided or ruled
                binding; can only be set aside by appealing the judgment before a higher forum <br><br>
                
                Circuit: 94 federal judicial districts are organized into 12 regional circuits, each of which has a court of appeals
                Each of the thirteen federal circuit courts is assigned one Supreme Court Justice, who considers certain appeals (e.g., emergency requests and other matters) from his or her assigned circuit while other aspects of the case are still pending <br><br>
                
                 but-for causation: an action is a cause of an injury if, but for the action, the injury wouldn't have occurred
                Ex. Driver of “Car A” runs a red light and hits “Car B,” which had a green light, causing injury to the driver of Car B <br><br>
                
                Textualism: a mode of legal interpretation that focuses on the plain meaning of the text of a legal document. Textualism usually emphasizes how the terms in the Constitution would be understood by people at the time they were ratified, as well as the context in which those terms appear <br>     <br>
